            <h4>Internship with Brave Initiatives</h4>
            <p class="text-black-50 mb-0"> 
            	This summer I will be working with Brave Initiatives, a nonprofit that was started in Chicago in 2015. The goal of Brave Initiatives is to empower girls to be agents of change in their own communities using design, coding, and leadership training. Brave currently provides camps in cities throughout the world such as Chicago, IL, Indianpolis, IN, Santa Fe, NM, Lancester, PN, and Jakarta, Indonesia. These camps last a full week and the girls work in teams to code a website on an issue of their choice in the areas of Environment, Education, Health, and Social Justice. Along with this, they also get leadership training, learn how to conduct interviews, give presentations, and reflect on their individual paths for the present and future. Brave Initiative sees the importance of having women and WOC in the tech world to solve critical problems as technology continues to grow! In my role as an intern for Brave Initiatives I will be traveling to these cities, with a cointern, to run the Brave Cirriculum for various groups of girls and provide them with the Brave Experience. </p>

During my time in Barcelona I lived with a Cataluyan host family, attended the Universitat de Barcelona, and did volunteer work at Terral, a womens shelter for immigrant women and youth. The main goals of Terral are women promotion, facilitate integration, and volunteer training. During my time at Terral I worked with immigrant girls of all backgrounds from ages 11-18. In my role as a volunteer, I helped with homework, one on one mentoring to help with English, and other fun group activities such as cooking!</p>

SST stands for Study Service Term, and provides Goshen College students the opportunity to live abroad with host families and complete 6 weeks of study, followed by 6 weeks of service. The first 6 weeks I lived in the cities capitol, Lima, and attended classes with fellow Goshen students. The following 6 weeks I then did my service component in the beautiful mountains of Cusco where I work with World Vision. World Vision is a "global Christian humanitarian organization and they work with children, families, and communities to reach their full potential by tackling the causes of poverty and injustice". During my time at World Vision Cusco I was responsible for translating documents such as sponsor letters.</p>

This program was a 6 week long, language intensive, summer study abroad program for Indiana HS students. Some of the important aspects of this program were that students could not speak any English, including to the other students in the group, and we weren't aloud to have our cell phones, as they were collected the day we landed in Merida. With total immersion being the target of IUHPFL, I got to live with a host family, study Spanish with classes in Grammar, Linguistics, Literature and Culture, and take group field trips to places like Tulum and Chichen Itza. After having this life changing experience in Merida, I decided Spanish was what I wanted to continue to pursue in College.</p>
